# Self_Balancing_Robot
This a simple PID model that use the gyroscope to measure the x,y,z and the model of control to sustain it's balance on two wheel.
I'm going to develop this project and make it to be controlled with phones(Android,IOS,WINDOWS), and the code that I'm going to write is all dart and flutter 
so this project is updating day by day...
